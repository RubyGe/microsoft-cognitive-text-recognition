## Text in an asset search portal quick prototype

## B/E
1. Create a DB with assets urls and their cognitive metadata fields, plus other fields such as date created, file size, file type, etc. as metadata. 
2. Run a script that grabs the directory of assets, run them against the cognitive data service, grab text info and parse JSON text info into a searchable format.
3. Perform a search in the DB and return the assets that suppose to show up.

Test how effective the prototye is in performing certain types of tasks.

## FE
1. Have an interface that shows the thumbnail of a list of assets in the directory
2. Have a search input box
3. Can perform search and return results
